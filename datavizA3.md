# Task Explanation
This visualisation assignment involved critiquing a data visualisation that I found online and felt could be improved. For this task I chose a visualisation that had to do with soccer, soccer is my favourite sport and something I feel very passionate about. The title of the chosen visualisation, "Will anyone ever beat Shearer's 260 Premier League Goal record". This was a visualisation I felt strongly about because I felt it did not adequately relate to soccer fans who, in my opinion, feel detached when talking about records set in the past. The reason being that, a lot of passionate tech savvy fans are too young to feel connected to these legends, plus the game was just different back then.

# Action
To re-create the visualisation I used a tool named basalmiq to create a wireframe depicting what direction I wanted to go in. I felt it necessary to change the story being told from one that glorified Alan Shearer's goal recored to one that predicted how current stars might fare in challenging his record.

# Feedback
Before moving on to create the new visualisation, I consulted two peers (respoders) to ask about their first impressions of the wireframe.
