# Outline
In a nutshell, my story is a tale of how living in an emerging city like Pittsburgh can be daunting. A lot of young tech savvy people come here every year for work or school. A lot of them International Students and/or individuals with no ties/visits prior. A lot of these people value a high-quality lifestyle. However, living a high-quality lifestyle in Pittsburgh isn’t easy or cheap. Co-living can ease the pain and add value to lives in the process.
