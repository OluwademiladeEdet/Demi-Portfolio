# Outline
In a nutshell, my story is a tale of how living in an emerging city like Pittsburgh can be daunting. A lot of young tech savvy people come here every year for work or school. A lot of them International Students and/or individuals with no ties/visits prior. A lot of these people value a high-quality lifestyle. However, living a high-quality lifestyle in Pittsburgh isn’t easy or cheap. Co-living can ease the pain and add value to lives in the process.

# Explanation
After completing the first part of story development, critiques and feedback shed light on a key issue. While the general picture was understood, people failed to see the lines being drawn between the data and the story being told. However, this was a bit of a blessing, it meant that in developing the next part of the story and storyboarding, that feedback could be utilised to make the process more robust. 

# Storyboard

      Pittsburgh loves co-living
      
# Why Pittsburgh?

Pittsburgh is a city in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny County. A population of about 301,048 residents live within the city limits, making it the 66th-largest city in the U.S. The metropolitan population of 2,324,743 is the second-largest in Pennsylvania, behind Philadelphia, and the 27th-largest in the U.S.

Pittsburgh is located in the southwest of the state, at the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers. Pittsburgh is known both as "the Steel City" for its more than 300 steel-related businesses and as the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges. 

Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum, glass, shipbuilding, petroleum, foods, sports, transportation, computing, autos, and electronics. For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. America's 1980s deindustrialization laid off area blue-collar workers and thousands of downtown white-collar workers when the long-time Pittsburgh-based world headquarters moved out. This heritage left the area with renowned museums, medical centers, parks, research centers, and a diverse cultural district. 

Today, Google, Apple Inc., Bosch, Facebook, Uber, Nokia, Autodesk, Microsoft and IBM are among 1,600 technology firms generating $20.7 billion in annual Pittsburgh payrolls. The area has served as the long-time federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy. The area is home to 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. The nation's eighth-largest bank, eight Fortune 500 companies, and six of the top 300 U.S. law firms make their global headquarters in the area, while RAND, BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer and NIOSH have regional bases that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.

# What is co-living?

Co-living is a type of intentional community providing shared housing for people with shared intentions. This may simply be coming together for activities such as meals and discussion in the common living areas yet may extend to shared workspace and collective endeavours such as living more sustainably.

Co-living as a modern concept loosely dates back nearly a century in the form of tenements yet may also be considered related to much older forms of communal living such as the longhouse. Its contemporary form has only gained prominence in recent years as a combination of factors have led to interest in this type of living space, including a lack of housing opportunities, the cost of independent accommodation and raising finance to purchase, plus a growing interest in lifestyles not dependent upon long-term contracts.

     Pittsburgh is the perfect fit for co-living because it has the perfect mix of scenario's for it to thrive.
     
# What makes a perfect incubator for co-living?

Pittsburgh represents a city well aligned with circumstances for co-living. Apart from 68 Colleges and Universities churning out over 40'000 graduates a year, immigration statistics show that employment and other opportunities have made the developing city a hotbed for the next generation. With a steady supply of young working class professionals, individuals with 'new generation' lifestyle choices - such as prolonged bachelor/bachelorette life stages, shift of focus to careers over family building and a general emphasis on mobility (not being tied down to a singular geographic region).



# User Research Protocol
After the storyboard creation was completed. The next step was creation of User research protocol to evaluate how the intended audience would react to the potential story being told.

# Goals / Questions
Goals
- Evaluate the story
- Evaluate the audience comprehension levels
- Identify what needs fixing/removal/addition

Questions
- Do people understand the entire narrative?
- Is the narrative compelling?
- Can the audience recall factors that align Pittsburgh with co-living?
- Is there a call to action?

# Metrics
- Whether participants understand what the site is about
- Whether participants seem engaged/excited to learn more and click into content

# Methods
- 10 Minute Interview
- Interview Target Participant: Pittsburgh college student (preferably living in off campus housing)
- Interview Notes
- In Person

# Script
- Introduction: Purpose of Interview, Reason participant was chosen
- Observation: Participant goes through storyboard
- Questions
   - Did you understand the general idea?
   - Do you agree/believe what you've just read?
   - Can you recall factors that align Pittsburgh with co-living?
   - Do you feel compelled to do anything?
   - Can you make any recommendations/things that could have helped make this more intruiguing to you?

# Feedback
- The story makes sense
- Audience would have liked to know how this could benefit them
- Audience would have liked to know how they could access the service 

# Revisions/Additions
Based on the feedback recieved, the area of main concern is the 'call to action', the part of the story that tells the audience what to do and why. Additionally, user research highlighted a good background story but felt there was no main story - the reason being that "It feels like opinions rather than facts" & "Can a comparison be made between these circumstances and succesful coliving in another city". Another common theme in feedback was the fact that the storyboard felt too educational. However, the point of the story was not to give/advertise to the user options in the coliving industry, but rather to create awareness of the benefits and educate the audience on how the data shows co-living would be beneficial to Pittsburgh. On this note the revisions to the original storyboard were to end the story with a more compelling call to action.

# What do Millenials that co-living offers?

By utilising co-living housing choices that create easier, more convenient living situations, the target market (which is growing in size as evidenced in the story) can better live a lifestyle that is more desirable from their perspective .

# Successful Co-Living Model

# Review
By adding the sections that show what coliving offers the audience & data from a successful co-living model in existence, the story feels more compelling, more truthful and more actionable. Now the audience has gained knowledge of how it can benefit them directly as well as a starting point for investigation into accessing the service. This closes the loop as mentioned in the user feedback.
