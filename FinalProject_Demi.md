# Outline
In a nutshell, my story is a tale of how living in an emerging city like Pittsburgh can be daunting. A lot of young tech savvy people come here every year for work or school. A lot of them International Students and/or individuals with no ties/visits prior. A lot of these people value a high-quality lifestyle. However, living a high-quality lifestyle in Pittsburgh isn’t easy or cheap. Co-living can ease the pain and add value to lives in the process.

# Explanation
After completing the first part of story development, critiques and feedback shed light on a key issue. While the general picture was understood, people failed to see the lines being drawn between the data and the story being told. However, this was a bit of a blessing, it meant that in developing the next part of the story and storyboarding, that feedback could be utilised to make the process more robust.

# Why Pittsburgh?

Pittsburgh is a city in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States, and is the county seat of Allegheny County. A population of about 301,048 residents live within the city limits, making it the 66th-largest city in the U.S. The metropolitan population of 2,324,743 is the second-largest in Pennsylvania, behind Philadelphia, and the 27th-largest in the U.S.

Pittsburgh is located in the southwest of the state, at the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers. Pittsburgh is known both as "the Steel City" for its more than 300 steel-related businesses and as the "City of Bridges" for its 446 bridges. 

Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in manufacturing of aluminum, glass, shipbuilding, petroleum, foods, sports, transportation, computing, autos, and electronics. For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita. America's 1980s deindustrialization laid off area blue-collar workers and thousands of downtown white-collar workers when the long-time Pittsburgh-based world headquarters moved out. This heritage left the area with renowned museums, medical centers, parks, research centers, and a diverse cultural district. 

Today, Google, Apple Inc., Bosch, Facebook, Uber, Nokia, Autodesk, Microsoft and IBM are among 1,600 technology firms generating $20.7 billion in annual Pittsburgh payrolls. The area has served as the long-time federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy. The area is home to 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. The nation's eighth-largest bank, eight Fortune 500 companies, and six of the top 300 U.S. law firms make their global headquarters in the area, while RAND, BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer and NIOSH have regional bases that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.

# What is co-living?

Co-living is a type of intentional community providing shared housing for people with shared intentions. This may simply be coming together for activities such as meals and discussion in the common living areas yet may extend to shared workspace and collective endeavours such as living more sustainably.

Co-living as a modern concept loosely dates back nearly a century in the form of tenements yet may also be considered related to much older forms of communal living such as the longhouse. Its contemporary form has only gained prominence in recent years as a combination of factors have led to interest in this type of living space, including a lack of housing opportunities, the cost of independent accommodation and raising finance to purchase, plus a growing interest in lifestyles not dependent upon long-term contracts.
